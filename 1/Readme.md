##This is dir contains programs which demonstrates zombie and orphan process of the following :

*a1* : Create a child process and assign task of computing the Fibonacci series.

*a2* : Implement the C program in which main program accepts the integers to be sorted. Main program uses the fork system call to create
 a new process called a child process. Parent process sorts the integers using merge sort and waits for child process using wait system
  call to sort the integers using quick sort. Also demonstrate zombie and orphan states.
